   - **Progress Bars**: Visual representation of completion percentages for each zone.  
   - **Tooltips**: Add hover info on worker names or task statuses for more detail.

2. **Design Improvements**  
   - Use **CSS cards** or **grid layouts** for better visual separation of zones and worker info.  
   - Add **icons** or **visual markers** for status (e.g., green checkmarks for completed, red exclamation for urgent).

3. **Advanced Functionality**  
   - Integrate **JavaScript** to dynamically update statuses (e.g., real-time progress bar updates).  
   - Embed a **contact form** or **complaint submission form** to directly capture new issues.
